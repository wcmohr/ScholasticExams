## Due November 22nd @9am

## Business Case

Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited _you_ via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on high school education outcomes.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on a [few national datasets][data] on [SAT and ACT][background] scores. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and [possible hypotheses][ps]!

## Directions

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". 

EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions. What you do in this project are good practices for all projects going forward, especially those after this bootcamp!

Spend your time trying to understand your data, through both summary statistics and visualization. By the end, you will want to be familiar enough with the datasets that you can think of [testable hypotheses][ps] that could point in specific policy directions.

We will be looking for the following things:

- For statistics questions, Python code -- using pandas, numpy, scipy, and/or other libraries -- to calculate correct answers, with Markdown explaining your results
- For plotting questions, labeled matplotlib plots displayed within your notebook, with Markdown interpreting the results

---

## Requirements

- Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook
  - Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**
  - More on the *structure of your submission repo* [here][deliverables]
- Students should demonstrate the ability to:

    - Analyze diverse datasets & explicitly state your assumptions
    - Form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy
    - Visualize and interpret your plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn

- You will also [present your findings][presentation] on August 10th
    - Assume you are presenting to the mayor (i.e., a non-technical audience)
    - You have up to **4 minutes** (absolutely no longer!)
    - You can choose to present on either or both tests
    - Your slides must be in google slides (absolutely no exceptions)
      - Download as .pdf to upload your slides to your repository

*TIP*: 4 minutes is not long.  Think about what is most important to talk about.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0, 1, 2, or 3). Instructors will use this [rubric][rubric] when scoring student performance on each of the [core project **requirements**][rubric]:

 Score | Expectations
 ----- | ------------
 **0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
 **1** | _Approaching expectations. Getting there..._
 **2** | _Meets expectations. Great job._
 **3** | _Exceeds expectations. Portfolio-ready!_

---

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
